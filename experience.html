This journey start when i started join the production team.At first i am very nervous because this is my first day in this team and i need to adapt with the environment and also the work. But the good thing about this team they very helpful and they are very friendly with me. Although only a few weeks of acquaintance I already feel comfortable with them and consider them like my own family.They taught me patiently about things I did not know. Other than that I am very happy and grateful to know them there. There is a lot of new knowledge I learned there. At the same time, I also gain my knowledge and experience at that time which is i'm still young and need to learn a lot of things. So that i will share with you guys my photo with the production team that will organise all the production things and the sample of every design before send to the factory. But this company also made a custom made appreal  for a person that required exact size and design. So,here we go! Enjoy  </h2>
