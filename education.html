<center><h5> What is the best things during my diploma is that , every friday our class will be in Uitm Shah Alam. Due to the unsufficient of  apparatus and machine in our Uitm Kuala Pilah, we need to attend our lab class in at Uitm Shah Alam. We have to get ready at 6 am every Friday to wait for the bus provided by uitm. The journey took 2 hours and although at first we felt tired but when it became a habit it was no longer a problem for us. It is also the most beautiful thing for me during the diploma because it can strengthen the friendship between seniors and juniors and I will share with you guys some memory when us at Uitm Shah Alam </h5>
